# WannVerbindung

"Wann Verbindung?!" ("when connection?!") is an app for regular commuters. It allows to configure a train station for home and one for work (or school or whereever you need to go regularly), as well as times you normally travel out- and inbound. You can then add a widget to your iPhone's lock screen or apple watch, which will display the next departure on your route.
